It’s a unique place having both marine and mountain tourist attractions. Though it is the longest beach in the world, the overwhelming majority of the tourists are local. Less than 5 per cent of its tourists are international.</div>

        <div>There has been a brilliant anti-plastic campaign at Cox’s Bazar beach by Bidyanondo Foundation a few months ago. They built a giant monster by plastic waste collected from beach to make people aware and help grow common civic senses, so tourists become aware of dumping plastic here and there while visiting Cox’s Bazar and the beach. Cox’s Bazar needs more of such campaigns to build public awareness on eco-tourism, environmental awareness, hospitality, cleanliness, eco-spirituality and so on. </div>
