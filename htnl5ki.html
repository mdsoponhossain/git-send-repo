    <section>PANTHUMAI<p>
        Panthumai – a village from West Jaflong Union under Guainghat Upazilla – is another tourism hub in Sylhet. The village, which is very near to the east Khasia hill of the Meghalaya ranges, boasts of an eye-catching fall popularly known as Borhill Fall. Though the main fall is geographically located in the Indian territory, people can enjoy its enormous splendour head-on. Flowing from the Borhill Fall is a branch of the river Piyain that heads west and leads to Bisnakandi, another major tourist spot.</p>

    <section>LAWACHERA<p>On the Vanugach-Komalganj Road about seven kilometres from Sreemongol town is the entry to Lauachora National Garden. It is an evergreen rainforest with excessive precipitation. Tall trees with their lofty branches and soaring foliage make for a unique cover for the forest on a sunny day. Lauachora is one of the seven safari parks and 10 national gardens in Bangladesh. An area of 1,250 hectares from the 2,740-hectare West Vanugach Reserve Forest was declared a national garden in 1996.</p></section>
    <section>JAFLONG<p>Despite the loss of its former splendour due to unrestricted mining and crushing of stones, Jaflong is still a ‘must-see’ destination for tourists visiting Sylhet. Flowing from the north Khasi mountains, the river Dauki enters Bangladesh under the name ‘Piyain’, along the bank of which lies the spectacular Jaflong. About 62 km north-east from Sylhet city, Jaflong is in the East Jaflong Union under Guainghat Upazilla. Visitors can hire boats to go to the Zero Point and see the beautiful hanging bridge over the Dauki. Just across the river on the western side are the villages Sangrampunji and Nakshiapunji, which are accessible through ferries or rented boats. Just beside Nakshiapunji is Jaflong Tea Garden which is a top tourist attraction.</p></section>
